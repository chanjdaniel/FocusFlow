# Project Title: FocusFlow
### nwPlus HackCamp 2023 project

## **Project Description:**
With accessibility, diversity and inclusivity in mind, we thought of creating a chrome extension to improve readability of online text. 
This extension is aimed at helping users with ADHD to better focus when reading webpages. Our chrome extension first creates an overlay containing only relevant text to block out distracting ads and page elements. Then, the text is modified to facilitate the bionic reading method which reduces the mental strain of reading long articles.

This is a front project that was made using Chrome API, Webkit tools, JS, HTML & CSS.

## **How To Run Our Program:**

1. enable dev mode in chrome://extensions
2. load unpacked extension
